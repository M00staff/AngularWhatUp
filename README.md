# AngularWhatUp
First Angular App

#Why did you pick this
Well - i spent quite a bit of time this weekend doing Angular tutorials online, so i wasnt really starting from scratch - and figured that this would be a GREAT opportunity for further practice on what i was doing.  This way i actualy started something from scratch instead of using tons of starter code.

#What problems does it solve?
if you need to look up the weather in Vienna it can kind of help out.  Just kidding - it helps with general fear and anxiety over learning Angular.  It's well commented and gives a VERY simple example of how controllers and views work - there is also an AJAX request to an API (which is much easier in Angular than anything else i've seen).  

#Why use
Well since i didn't have time to finish (i wanted to parse and display the JSON correctly), its best use would be as starter code for a future project.  

#History of technology
AngularJS (commonly referred to as "Angular") is an open-source web application framework maintained by Google and by a community of individual developers and corporations to address many of the challenges encountered in developing single-page applications. It aims to simplify both the development and the testing of such applications by providing a framework for client-side model–view–controller (MVC) and model–view–viewmodel (MVVM) architectures, along with components commonly used in rich Internet applications.

#Opinions
It's a very powerful and useful framework - not really necessary for a small/simple website though.  It's meant for scaling and use with gigantic sites.

#Conceptual hurdles
Convention is hard to get used to with this one in the same way as Rails - when to use singular and/or uppercase and when to put everything in one file or to separate it all.  

#Resources for students
The CodeSchool course was amazing - i also did the CodeAcademy course which wasn't as amazing but useful for hammering some concepts in

#Interview questions
Why use Angular, what problems does it solve?
Favorite parts/least favorite parts?
Biggest hurdles to learning the framework?

#Use
you have to link to the CDN in your index.html as well as link to all of your .js files.  On top of that - you need to use the ng-controller directive to link to each controller - when using ng-controller you use the name you set at the top of the controller and NOT the file name (found out the hard way)
